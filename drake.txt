drunk off champagne screamin in the phone
see my house is not a home fuck is goin on
where did we go wrong where do we belong
caught up in the game and it's one i can't postpone
meaning if it rains i'm the one it's raining on
when my diamond chain is on still nothing set in stone
women borrow sweaters that i spray with my cologne
and tell me don't forget em and i promise that i won't
feelin so distant from everyone i've known
to make everybody happy i think i would need a clone
places we get flown parties that we've thrown
i've done more for this city then these rappers that have blown
it's only been years look at how i've grown
i'm just in my zone i call this shit the calm
yea but i'm the furthest thing from calm
dedicated to my mom and i swear my word is bond
everything will be ok and it won't even take that long
you can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
leader of the new school it's proven and it's known
i'm sittin in a chair but in the future it's a throne
i know you like to worry it'll be better if you don't cause
you know everything gone be alright i promise a
pologize to you know to put ya'll in this position and vent to ya'll but
mom always say don't ask permisson just ask forgiveness
you know so forgive me
uh and life is so insane look what i've became tryna make a name
all my first dates are interrupted by my fame
because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
they love it when you smile unaware that it's a strain
it's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
women need attention and fore women will complain
develop hatred for men and say that your the one to blame
tryna enjoy myself with taz in miami at the game
i just wish he knew how much it really weighed like dwayne
it's a weight that's on my chest whoever spottin me is playin
so i'm liftin all alone try not to get a sprain
hopin western union doing currency exchange
cause my dad called and got me feelin guilty and ashamed
like how i had a rolls and i went and got a range
and he payin for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
damn and i could only feel his pain
cause in memphis tennessee there's only so much to attain
so i'm fillin out the form at the counter once a gain
he say he love me i just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
i'm why ya girl heart is in a slang
call me heartbreak drake i'm the hardest one to tame
as a man i'm just honest as a artist i'm a king
with my own set of problems that be sittin on my brain
yea and see this is the thang
what they viewing as braggin is the way that i maintain
the shit i write while staring out the window of a plane
is the single handed reason i remain
me yea uh i said i call this shit the calm
but i'm the furthest thing from calm
i swear i'm puttin on but they always wanna ask what type of act you puttin on like man
this is why i do this shit
i think they call this venting
look
this is me still the same
they want the hits i play the game
no auto tune but you can feel the pain
it all comes spilling out like i hit a vein
what up lil bruh what up slum ville
i hope you know that y'all the reason i have fun still
the fans thinking that we all signed for mil
equal opportunity rappin that shit is unreal
that ain't how it works that ain't how it goes
and i been gettin high just to balance out the lows
and i could use a writer just to balance out my flows
but i never share my thoughts this is all a nigga knows
and everytime i try it opens up my eyes
these verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised
and i will be performin this as long as i'm alive
so every word i utter will be mine
don't believe the lies
look me in my eyes
please don't be scared of me
please don't be scared of me
i remember you
this feeling isn't new
so please don't be scared of me
please don't be scared of me
oh oh oh oh oh yeah
i never cried when pac died
but i probably will when hov does
and if tears hold value
then i will drop one for every single thing he showed us
and i'll be standing in a puddle
i stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble
and i'mma keep it honest i'm so tired of being subtle
it's just me forty o and neek standing in a huddle
staring at the members of my team
who get questioned about they profit
from this million dollar scheme
just know that i'm in debt for you defending all our dreams
i hope you tell your family this shit ain't what it seems
but y'all the reason for a lot of my devotion
you know i spend money because spending time is hopeless
and know i pop bottles cuz i bottle my emotions
at least i put it all in the open
dont believe the lies
look me in my eyes
please don't be scared of me
please don't be scared of me
i remember you
this feeling isnt new
so please don't be scared of me
please don't be scared of me
oh oh oh oh oh yeah
look
fuck all y'all we ignore feelings here
premature millionaires
welcome to my realest year
yeah i swear that we making a killing here
i should be on top of the world just chillin here
but it's funny having fans
who find you before anybody ever has the chance
and build you up so you could be the biggest in the game
and realize when you're there
sometimes the shit don't feel the same
yeah and plus things are just surreal at home
people think i've changed just cause my appeal has grown
and now security follows me everywhere
so i never actually am alone i just always feel alone
i think i'm scared of what the future holds
i was wishing for some things and now am used to those
every girl i meet thinks im fucking groupie hoes
the honesty of my music has left me too exposed
all my old friends think i got a new crowd
and people seem to notice every time i do smile
i guess that mean they come few and far between
even though i'm living out what you would call the dream
yeah
and my uncle aint even messaging me
and him missing in my life is kind of messing with me
i hope this isnt one of those forever things
its funny how money can change everything
dont believe the lies
look me in my eyes
please dont be scared of me
please dont be scared of me
i remember you
this feeling isnt new
so please dont be scared of me
please dont be scared of me
money just changed everything i wonder how life without it would go
from the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
lookin down from the top and it's crowded below
my fifteen minutes started an hour ago
truth over fame you know i respect the blatant shit
when i hear talkin i just don't know what to make of it
hate is so familiar to me i'm slowly embracin it
doesn't come natural bear with me it could take a bit
yeah and my dreams are who i'm racing with
as you can see i'm pacin it so that i'm always chasin it
wayne put me right here that's who i get the paper with
i hope that my success never alters our relationship
yeah this life is something i would die for
october's on but it's lookin like july four
i just wish they'd let you try it first
this time i'm really goin off fireworks
oh today it begins
i've missed them before
but won't miss them again
i keep having the same dream
and i think i just realized what it means
all i see is fireworks all i see is fireworks
every night is fireworks every night is fireworks
all i see is fireworks all i see is fireworks
taking off like fireworks taking off like
i'm just such a gentleman you should give it up for me
look at how i'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery
i could tell it wasn't love i just thought you fuck with me
who coulda predicted lucky strike would have you stuck with me
damn i kept my wits about me luckily
what happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me
now all of a sudden these gossip rags wanna cover me
and you making it seem that it happened that way because of me
but i was curious
and i'll never forget it baby what an experience
you coulda been the one but it wasn't that serious
there was smoke in the air before that was me clearing it
that felt good all and all i learned a lesson from it though
you never see it coming you just get to see it go
yeah i shoulda looked up in the sky at first
now i see it in her eyes fireworks
oh today it begins
i've missed them before
but won't miss them again
i keep having the same dream
and i think i just realized what it means
all i see is fireworks all i see is fireworks
every night is fireworks every night is fireworks
all i see is fireworks all i see is fireworks
taking off like fireworks taking off like
everything the same but it feels different
my dad called me up knowing that i still listen
and he's still got his foot out guilt trippin
it's been years though i just learn to deal with it
for real me and my realtor we built up a better rapport
got my mother in a place with some better decor
she searched the entire city i let her explore
and now she sayin she more lonely than ever before
how many of our parents marriages lasted
i was only i bet i barely reacted
i'm flying back home for the heritage classic
searching for that feeling tell me where is the magic
let's stay together til we're ghosts
i wanna witness love i never seen it close
yeah but i guess i gotta find it first
that's why i'm really going off fireworks
oh today it begins
i've missed them before
but won't miss them again
i keep having the same dream
and i think i just realized what it means
all i see is fireworks all i see is fireworks
every night is fireworks every night is fireworks
all i see is fireworks all i see is fireworks
taking off like fireworks taking off like

and i swear i got this shit that makes these bitches go insane
so they tell me that they love me i know better than that it's just game
it's just what comes from fame
and i'm ready for that i'm just saying
i really can't complain everything is kosher
two thumbs up ebert and roeper
i really can't see the end getting any closer
but i'll probably still be the man when everything is over
so i'm riding through the city with my high beams on

to men that i know well
that way there are no lies
you could thank me now for all the info i give to you niggas
i'm on the brink of influential
i'm here for you niggas
i guess a hit doesn't add up to a career for you niggas
i must have been hard to watch
what a year for you niggas

you got the resolutions we just got reservations
living out a dream it feels like i stayed up
and we just wanna party patron straight up
fuck that old shit i'm on new things
ovo clique red wing boot gang
yeah we want it all half was never the agreement
who'd thought the route we chose would ever end up this scenic
i could relate to kids going straight to the league
when they recognise that you got what it takes to succeed
and thats around the time that your idols become your rivals
you make friends with mike but gotta ai him for your survival
damn i swear sports and music are so synonomous
cause we wanna be them and they wanna be us
yeah so on behalf of the demanded
and the entertainment that you take for granted
you could thank me now
and oh my goodness you're welcome
you're welcome
at this point me is who i'm trying to save myself from
rappers hit me up and i never know what to tell them
cause they think that i can help them get back to where they fell from
but drink up because everyone here is good tonight
except the niggas that i came with they good for life
yeah thats how you know it's going down
in case another chance never comes around
you could thank me now
uh go head
thank me later yeah i know what i said
but later doesn't always come so instead it's okay
you could thank me now
uhh shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming
i think i'm spending all my time with the wrong women
i think i have a chance at love but knowing me i miss it
cause me dedicating my time just isn't realistic
man the good girls went silent on me
they got a boyfriend or left for college on me
and all the bad ones i used to hit her friends now
that make me wish i had a little less mileage on me
but do i ever come up in discussion over double pump latte's
and low fat muffin's do i
or is missing what we had outta the question
i'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
i got flows for the marilyn monroe's who's there before it all
i guess thats how it goes
they hear about your cons or focus on your pro's
and love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul
but those same ones from your area will grow
into women that are ready to get married at hello
because of what they allow
where are they all now
i know there somewhere watching so i'm trying to make them proud
searching for the meaning
you'll find it next to me
and tell me i'm the highest guess we finally get to see
i'm feeling like nas who am i to disagree
they say that doors open up as soon as you find the missing key
it's probably why i'm in this bitch shining
jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
i rep the atf in case you need to be reminded
and the bandwagons full but you can try and run behind it
i'm sorry poolside drinking
margharita rounds
shout out to my city though i hardly be in town
i'm the black sheep but chris farley wears the crown
and i know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down
i'm in the world where things are taken never given
how long they choose to love you will never be your decision
and i'm aware that this could be the last time you listen
so while i'm still here in this position
you could thank me now
uh go head
thank me later yeah i know what i said
but later doesn't always come so instead it's okay
you could thank me now
how i'm feeling it doesn't matter
cause you know i'm okay
and still i ask myself why do you worry
when you know i'm the same
i know i know you don't love me baby
they're trying to take you away from me
only over my dead body
i think i killed everybody in the game last year man
fuck it i was on though
and i thought i found the girl of my dreams at a strip club
fuck it i was wrong though
shout out all to all my niggas living tax free
nowadays it's six figures when they tax me
oh well i guess you lose some and win some
long as the outcome is income
you know i want it all and then some
shout out to asian girls let the lights dim some

probably some bad hoes i'm bout to take the hint from
yeah you know me well nigga

slave to the pussy but i'm just playing the field nigga
are these people really discussing my career again
asking if i'll be going platinum in a year again
don't i got the shit the world wanna hear again
don't michael jordan still got his hoop earring in
man all of your flows bore me paint drying
and i don't ever be trippin off of what ain't mine
and i be hearing the shit you say through the grapevine
but jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
it's been that way from the beginning
i just been playing i ain't even even notice i was winning
and this is the only sound you should fear
man these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright
how i'm feeling it doesn't matter
cause you know i'm okay
and still i ask myself why do you worry
when you know i'm the same
i know i know you don't love me baby
they're trying to take you away from me
only over my dead body
you say i'm old news well who the new star
cause if i'm going anywhere it's probably too far

the men are jealous and the women all in competition
and now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
and taint all your images of mr perfect

and she's the reason it happened but she's overreacting
and it's all because she don't want things to change
so cry if you need to but i can't stay to watch you
that's the wrong thing to do
touch if you need to but i can't stay to hold you
that's the wrong thing to do
talk if you need to but i can't stay to hear you
that's the wrong thing to do
cause you'll say you love me and i'll end up lying
and say i love you too
but i need someone different
you know it oh ho you know it
oh ho you know it we both know it
i need someone different
you know it oh ho you know it
oh ho you know it we both know it
something's been missing
you know it oh ho she knows it
oh ho i know it we all know it
i need someone different
oh ho oh ho
we live in a generation of not being in love and not being together
but we sure make it feel like we're together
cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else
so cry if you need to but i can't stay to watch you
that's the wrong thing to do
touch if you need to but i can't stay to hold you
that's the wrong thing to do
talk if you need to but i can't stay to hear you
that's the wrong thing to do
cause you'll say you love me and i'll end up lying
and say i love you too
but i need someone different
you know it oh ho you know it
oh ho you know it we both know it
i need someone different
you know it oh ho you know it
oh ho you know it we both know it
something's been missing
you know it oh ho she knows it
oh ho i know it we all know it
i need someone different
oh ho oh ho

and this saddens me i see the pecking order
quote unquote bad bitches work the whole floor
those that get laughed at sit off in the corner
like a lab rat nobody want her
niggas that are married don't wanna go home
we look up to them they wish they were us
they want some new trim
we lust for some trust
now the both of us are colorblind
cause the other side looks greener
which leaves your turf in the boise state
can't see her play or the team cuz
everybody has an addiction mine happens to be you
and those who say they don't
souls will later on say to them that ain't true
all of them will have an opinion
but y'all know what you can do with them
but if you unsure i'll take you on tour
to a place i can stick that in
well sitting here sad as hell
listening to adele i feel you baby

or someone that's familiar maybe
and i can tell that she wants a baby
and i can yell girl that shit crazy
oh what the hell nope can't be lazy
please be careful bitches got the rabies
it's like in your basement and i'm in love with nebby
and i still love her but it fell through because i wasn't ready
and your back hurt and your neck hurt and you smoking heavy
and i sit next to you and i lecture you cause those are deadly
and then you ask shit and we argue about spending money on bullshit
and you tell me i'm just like my father my one button you push it
now it's fuck you i hate you i'll move out in a heartbeat
and i leave out and you call me tell me that your sorry
you love me and i love you and your heart hurts mine does too
and it's just words and they cut deep but it's our world it's just us two
i see painkillers on the kitchen counter i hate to see it all hurt so bad
but maybe i wouldn't have worked as hard
if you were healthy and it weren't so bad
uh maybe i should walk up the street and try and get a job at the bank
cause leave it up to me j and neeks we're probably gonna end up robbing a bank

i dropped the ball on some personal shit i need to embrace it

them strep throat flows them shits to stop all of the talkin
all of the talkin got one reply for all of your comments

how much time is this nigga spendin on the
if there's hell below i'll see you when you get there
are you enjoying yourselves if we may we'd just like to close off with something
a bit inspirational
hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears shedding
similar tears
and of course dying in so many years it don't mean that we can't have a good life
so we'd like to just maybe close out with something some food for thought
somewhere between psychotic and iconic
somewhere between i want it and i got it
somewhere between i'm sober and i'm lifted
somewhere between a mistress and commitment
but i stay down girl i always stay down
get down have her lay down
promise to break everybody off before i break down
everyone just wait now
so much on my plate now
people i believed in they don't even show their face now

we used to be friends girl and even back then
you would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby it's yours
nobody else's yeah this shit belong to nobody it's yours

i know luckily i didn't have to grow there
i would only go there cause there's niggas that i know there
i don't know what's getting into me
i just like the rush when you see your enemy somewhere in the club
and you realize he just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
you ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
people like mazin who was a best friend to me
start to become a distant memory
things change in that life and this life started lacking synergy
and fucking with me mentally i think it's meant to be
paranoid always rolling with my mothafuckin boys

with them bitches i don't get it you're a star love
you shouldn't have to deal with that
i'd never make you feel like that cause
i love me i love me enough for the both of us
that's why you trust me i know you been through more than most of us
so what are you what are you what are you so afraid of
darling you you give but you cannot take love
i needed to hear that shit i hate when you're submissive
passive aggressive when we're texting i feel the distance
i look around the peers that surround me these niggas tripping
i like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
started realizing a couple places i could take it
i want to get back to when i was that kid in the basement
i want to take it deeper than money pussy vacation
and influence a generation that's lacking in patience
i've been dealing with my dad speaking of lack of patience
just me and my old man getting back to basics
we've been talking bout the future and time that we wasted
when he put that bottle down girl that nigga's amazing
well fuck it we had a couple nas
we might have rolled a white paper just something to hold us
we even talked about you and our couple of moments
he said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
you a flower child beautiful child i'm in your zone
looking like you came from the on your own
my mother is and her favorite line to hit me with is
who the fuck wants to be and alone
you don't even know what you want from love anymore
i search for something i'm missing and disappear when i'm bored
but girl what qualities was i looking for before
who you settling for who better for you than the boy huh
thinking bout texas back when porscha used to work at treasures
or further back than that before i had the houston leverage
when i got summer a michael kors with my momma's debit
a weak attempt at flexing i'll never forget it
cause that night i played her three songs
then we got to talking bout something we disagreed on
then she start telling me how i'll never be as big as trey songz
boy was she wrong that was just negative energy for me to feed off
now it's therapeutic blowing money in the galleria
or beverly center macy's where i discovered bria
landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
when i could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
the one that i needed was courtney from hooters on peachtree
i've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
now she engaged to be married what's the rush on commitment
know we were going through some shit name a couple that isn't
remember our talk in the parking lot at the ritz
girl i felt like we had it all planned out i guess i fucked up the vision
learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
when you find out how i'm living i just hope i'm forgiven
it seem like you don't want this love anymore
i'm acting out in the open it's hard for you to ignore
but girl what qualities was i looking for before
who you settling for who better for you than the boy huh

like i should be dressin different
like i should be less aggressive and pessimistic
like i should be way more nervous and less dismissive
like i should be on my best behavior
and not talk my shit and do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
like i didn't study the game to the letter
and understand that i'm not doin it the same man i'm doin it better
like i didn't make that clearer this year
like i should feel i don't know guilty for saying that
they should put a couple more mirrors in here so i can stare at myself
these are usually just some thoughts that i would share with myself
but i thought fuck it
it's worth it to share em with someone else more than paris for once
i text her from time to time she a mom now
i guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
i told her she could live with me if she need to
i got a compound but i think she's straight
cause she supported since hot beats right before wayne came
and got me out of the backroom where i was rapping with jas over beats i shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory
he walked right past in the hallway months later i'm his artist
he probably wouldn't remember that story
but that shit stick with me
always couldn't believe when he called me

that nigga still wearing linen that nigga still in the club
call him after we get off the phone and show him some love
that nigga memphis for real girl he love you to death
he made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept
but he just want our forgiveness and fuck it look how we living
i'm content with this story who are we not to forgive him
at least i been to a prison at least i know what it's like
i used to rap on the phone one of his friends doing life
and now i got me a grammy that could be part of the reason
let's just call this shit even we got some things to believe in
do you remember back to weston road scarlett road
hangin with shit could've gone south for me he looked out for me ma
he never let me do drugs
he let me shoot a gun one summer but out there everyone does
he made me listen to his music old music soul music
shit that can only be created if you go through it
i used to get teased for being black and now i'm here and i'm not black enough
cause i'm not acting tough or making stories up bout where i'm actually from
but i just roll with it momma rolling stone with it momma
gotta be careful around rolling stones or anyone that's tryna throw stones at me momma
i'm not condoning it momma

hard labor let me pay the price
you and the six raised me right that shit saved my life

the things you do
these days i'm letting god handle all things above me
the things i can't change are the reasons you love me

i'm all over the place i can't sit in one place
i'm not ashamed at all
still findin myself let alone a soulmate i'm just sayin

what am i supposed to do after we done doing everything we do
who is your replacement
are we still good are we still good
are we still good are we still good
yeah oh you gotta love it
oh you got oh you gotta love it
i heard what circulated let's get to the bottom of it
i told send me something and i got it covered
somehow always rise above it
why you think i got my head in the clouds on my last album cover
the game is all mine and i'm mighty possessive
lil wayne could not have found him a better successor
every shot you see them take at me they all contested
allen iverson shoe deal these niggas all in question
last night i went to sleep wanted more
tried to decide what direction i should go towards
some nights i wish i could go back in life
not to change shit just to feel a couple things twice
at midnight wonder what's next for me
longevity wonder how long they'll check for me
prolly forever if i stay in my zone
i speak on this generation but can't change it alone
i heard a lil lil homie talking reckless in vibe
quite a platform you chose you shoulda kept it inside
oh you tried it's so childish calling my name on the world stage
you need to act your age and not your girl's age
it gets worse by the annual my career's like a how to manual
so i guess it's understandable man
oh you gotta love it you gotta love it cheer
i know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get em
to show they outfits off guess they need the attention
i remember when it used to be music that did it
but then again times have changed man who are we kiddin
i'm managed by my friends that i grew up with
i'd rather give that to people i fuck with
if me and future hadn't made it with this rappin
we prolly be out in silicon tryna get our billions on
but here we are yeah
lately i feel the haters eatin away at my confidence
they scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
bitches alter my message like we have words
and stories bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
bitter women i'm overtextin are pmsing crazy this year
fuckin with my image
i've been tryna reach to you so i can save em this year
fuck it i guess i gotta wait til next year
and i heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
bout how we need protection from those protectin the block
nobody lookin out for nobody
maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
instead of bein somebody that makes the news
so everybody can tweet about it
and then they start to rip about it
and four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
damn i just had to say my peace about it
oh you gotta love it
but they scared of the truth so back to me showin out in public
that's a hotter subject
i've been whippin mercedes and nigga try to budget
i gotta make it back to memphis to check on my cousins
shout out to ashley biama julia ericka southern america
part of my heritage pardon my arrogance part in my hair again
that's that comeback flow comeback flow
once i start it's apparent
i wanted a girl whose ass is so big that's partly embarrassin
but fuck all the blushin and fuck your discussions
and fuck all the judgement
your content so aggressive lately what's irkin you
shit is gettin so personal in your verses too
i wanna prove that i'm number one over all these niggas
bein number two is just being the first to lose
my city dictated music nobody seein us
winter here already but somehow i'm heatin up
been observin the game and felt like i've seen enough
let's drop a tape on these niggas then we'll see what's up
yea boy you rappin like you seen it all

best i ever had seems like a decade ago
decadent flow and i still got a decade to go
oh please take at ease where's the love and the peace
why you rappin like you come from the streets
i got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
and i'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
phantom slidin like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
i cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
special order for anybody that's comin for me
shit you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
you see they got me back like it's just oli and me
cuttin all loose ends i be the barber for free
i'm almost at four minutes going off on the beat
feel like i'm in the malibu that had the cloth on the seats
man oh you gotta love it
and on top of that it's getting harder to eat
rappers downgrading houses
putting cars on the lease
to think labels said they had a problem marketing me
and now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe

but i'm not really sure what else you expected
when the higher ups have all come together as a collective
with conspiracies to end my run and send me a message
did you get the message
cause i just checked my phone and i didn't get it
i mean i say hats off for a solid effort
but we didn't flinch for a second we got our shit together
yeah not here to fight wars
but niggas wanna talk high scores
party just dipped off in a white porsche
and i just came from dinner where i ate some well done seared scallops that were
to die for
but i got bigger fish to fry
i'm talking bigger shit than you and i
kids are losin lives got me scared of losing mine
and if i hold my tongue about it i get crucified
wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night
flying over chattanooga out here trying to spread the movement
i just got me the mercedes pullman
you niggas never heard of it you gotta hit up google
back in the city shit is getting brutal
these kids'll hit your noodle then take a girl to the movies
they've been dropping out on both sides
we ain't in it we just ghost ride
the pen is working if you niggas need some ghost lines
i thought you wanted yours like i want mine
i guess you just making moves on your own time
but just know it'll be january in no time
and your absence is very concerning
it's like you went on vacation with no plan of returning
shit is purely for sport i need a for
banners are ready in case we need to retire your jersey
i got a club in the raptors arena
championships celebrations during regular seasons
paternity testing for women that i never slept with
i'm legally obligated if they request it
so much legal action like i'm michael jackson
luckily i'm great at avoiding distraction
used to give no reaction now i'm overreacting
ah nigga that shit gotta go platinum
i just listened to closer to my dreams
wide eyed and uneducated at
i can't rap like that all young and naive
not after all of the shit i've seen and the things i believe
drastically changing thank you for all your patience
i'm just in a different space and i choose to embrace it
square feet just isn't as spacious
you loved me back in the basement guess it is what we make it
i'm tired of awkward exchanges and nigga's crooked ways
tired of champagne toasts with people that look away
peyton and eli when niggas called me they brother the season start
and i don't wanna see you end up with nothing
y'all throw the word family around too much in discussion
rookie season i would've never thought this was coming
they knees give out and they passing to you all of a sudden
now you the one getting buckets
they put their arm around you now you becoming the crutches
kids got on your number cause you the one they look up to
and women that you seen on tv look better in person
and either they wanna fuck you or convince you that they can to see where it goes
from there
but these ain't the girls from brampton this ain't that local action
the haters just bringing me and my people closer actually
what happened to the things you niggas said was supposed to happen
are we just supposed to ignore the fact that it never happened
we just supposed to get the pie and then split it in two
supposed to forget your mistakes but not forget about you
my plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf
and treat the money like secrets keep that shit to ourselves
papi champu young pablito de seis dios
g o d i think i
was destined for this shit when i was round keyshia cole and t i
and young dro was popping off with ain't i
way before niggas had they hands out like they doing macarena
but who am i to complain now i'm still around they know
it's a little chilly out there
how you can stand there is beyond me
all of my let's just be friends are friends i don't have anymore
how do you not check on me when things go wrong
guess i should've tried to keep my family closer
much closer
all of my let's just be friends are friends i don't have anymore
guess that's what they say you need family for
cause i can't depend on you anymore
always saw you for what you could've been
ever since you met me
like when chrysler made that one car that looked just like the bentley
i always saw you for what you could've been
and even when it's business with you it's personal again
i knew you before you made ends meet now were meeting our ends
and its all because you chose a side
you're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
guess it wasn't time
and of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine
you're so predictable i hate people like you
kennedy road taught me not to trust people like you
how you supposed to figure what i'm going through
you can't even figure out what's going on with you
you judge fore you met me yeah it figures
i make all the player's anthems for the real niggas
with my dad out in tennessee is where i belong
out here in l a i don't know what's going on
i don't know what's going on
and its all because you chose a side
you're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
guess it wasn't time
and of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine
you sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
my luck is a sure thing cause i'm living right
when i needed you you couldn't give me any advice
but you always had something to say every other time
everybody that i met on the way tries to get in the way
i'm fooding and serving them all like i'm working for minimum wage
someone up there must just love testing my patience
someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
forgiveness for your ways
if i ever loved ya i'll always love ya that's how i was raised
same way i'm right here still feeling the wave
same way i'm realizing on a day to day
all of my let's just be friends are friends i don't have anymore
how do you not check on me when things go wrong
guess i should've tried to keep my family closer
much closer
all of my let's just be friends are friends i don't have anymore
guess that's what they say you need family for
cause i can't depend on you anymore
much closer
anytime people want to start problems
for real are you done
you know who mans are
i'm not afraid no gyal heart man
and i'm not afraid of no catty
and i'm not afraid of no waste neither
so anybody who want it can get it
its that fact
yeah for the dogs dem you know
man when shit gets like this in the whole city
this shit ain't gonna stop
it's gonna get a lot worse before it gets any better
momma hit my phone and said rap's no good
better than em telling me the check's no good
now they wanna act like i do no good
funny cause i really did more than i should
i made a decision last night that i would die for it
just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
you know wants peace but i'm down to cut ties for it
and i can't sleep these days unless i take one
if they don't have a story these days they'll make one

weston road flows i did this shit for my nigga renny
back when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies
feel like we go back a century runnin the store for centuries
then bring it back to your brother man we had to respect it
he was wavy doin mixtapes out of your basement
he let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
we probably would've got in less trouble just goin with him
feel like i never say much but man there's a lot to know
feel like the difference between us really startin to show
i'm lookin at they first week numbers like what are those
i mean you boys not even coming close
i gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
you number one and i'm eddie murphy we tradin places
lookin in the mirror i'm closer than i really appear
creepin like chilli without the tender love and care
no tender love and care and no love and affection
i got a price on my head but there's a risk to collect it
i might be here as a vessel to teach people the lesson
feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
yeah but here we are and it's a new semester
the only one that know how i deal with the pressure
a couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings faded
a lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
your best day is my worst day i get green like earth day
you treat me like i'm born yesterday you forgot my birthday
you don't be scorin perfect you don't be workin like how we be workin
you platinum like rappers on hershey's boy that shit is worthless
you get the message over and over like it was urgent
and then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
the only thing i did to end up here was put the work in
and did it with a purpose
used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
nowadays they just shakin my hand to hide the tension
a lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
shout out to kd we relate we get the same attention
it's rainin money oklahoma city thunder
the most successful rapper and under
i'm assumin everybody's and under
that's when i plan to retire man it's already funded

now the talk of the corner store is that i'm tbe
the best ever don't ever question you know better
but shit ain't always how it seems when it's sewed together
yeah i let that last line breathe it take a second to get it
weston road flows my confidence level gettin settled
don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal
don't let your new found fame fool you or cloud up your judgement

and i never bare my morals for the ticket sales
tipping scales bars heavy like triple xl

running through the storming through the contracts
i'm possessed you can see it under the contacts
they think i had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon

that's not respectable all of a sudden
i don't get a pat on the back for the come up
what do you see when you see me
when did all the things i mean
from the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning
maybe i share it with too many people
back then it used to just feel like our secret
back when i would write
and not think about how they receive it
i be tryna manifest the things i needed
and look now i mean it's hard to believe it even for me
but you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
how they go from not wantin me at all
to wantin to see me lose it all
things get dark but my aura just starts glowin
i'm overcome with emotions
ones i can't access when i'm stoned sober
jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
i could only speak what i know of
man we wrote the book on calculated thinkin
and icy heineken drinkin and rival neighborhoods linkin
and puttin your trust in someone
with the risk of financially sinkin
all you did was write the book on garbage ass rollies
ego strokin picture postin
claimin that you'd do it for motivational purposes only
but you just had to show me
see i know cause i study you closely
i know when someone lyin
i notice people standin for nothin and gettin tired

all that drake hysteria
six side east side all that for my area
you know hun i'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that i'm hearing in your voice these days
i can appreciate where your uncertainly stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust
but that attitude will just hold you back in this life and you're going to continue to feel alienated
give some thought to this because i'm confident in you and i know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation i'm hearing in your tone these days when others go low we go high
watch out for me i'm bound to glow
you better watch out for me i'm bound to glow
your boy all glowed up
every time we touch down bet it go up
member doin shows ain't nobody show up

no more to autopilot dri i ive
used to work the fries now we supersize

all the love i need is at the rodeo

maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
last table left in carbone callin plays on a rotary phone
i take a glass it don't mean nah don't go with me home
might move our annual shit to the dome
i need people to see what i'm on
yeah ducked a lot of spiteful moves
i was an angry youth when i was writin views
saw a side of myself that i just never knew
i'll probably self destruct if i ever lose but i never do
steady doin double shifts
doin the beat and i open up like a double click
more blessings because i'm generous
thirty seater plane for like ten of us
remember when i bought sealey the fake chanel wallet
she knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
nowadays when we catchin up we just laugh about it
can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
scary whenever i close my eyes at night
wakin up to public statements about my private life
i can never sleep til morning on all my quiet nights
but you can rest assure that my mind is right
get no sick days i leave for like three months in six days
never stick around to see shit change
get lil updates texts in my inboxes have been poppin
seasons go by like i'm binge watchin
went from club palazzo in the bridge to club liv
to not even showin up to a club less we doin bis
i can't even party while a nigga pursuin this
distractions will do you in in the truest sense
especially people that want to lecture me and frame it like they just want the best for me
or they check for me whatever splits it up
so there's more for them and there's less for me
they don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
no one's done it successfully
in germany can't believe that they heard of me
last verse that i gotta do is always like surgery
always tryin to let go of anything that'll burden me
that's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
last chance i get to make sure that you take it personally
take this shit to heart it's always executed perfectly
if we do a song it's like takin my kids to work with me
you overnight celebrity you one day star
swear i told you that i'm in this bitch for eternity
i am a reflection of all of your insecurities
behind closed doors a lot of god worshipping
done talk now cause there's other shit that's concernin me
there's real ones around me
i want to make sure they learn from me
i want to see my dog but his grandmother's his surety
he can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
my life is set around competition and currency
takin summer off cause they tell me i need recovery
maybe gettin back to my regular life will humble me
i'll be back in to give you the summary
more life

at award shows cuttin through the tension of course
girls huggin me then askin me what scent that is boy
i be walkin around the six like i invented it boy
yeah who am i the do or die

they try to compare us
but like a job straight outta high school there's no you and i
i taught you everything you know now you got student pride
all factual i call the house the embassy
the studio the chapel i hate to travel
i just pulled up on solana show the girl's a natural
i knew her way back when hollywood was international
yeah the furthest i've been that's word to my ends
word to the flags that belong in the hood of my benz
very presidential i broke all the codes for zonin in my residential
i broke spirits that i never meant to
my body isn't much of a sacred temple with vodka and wine
and sleep at the opposite times
promise shit is gettin outta line like when you make a stencil
or gettin outta line like when you break a pencil
violatin the treaty of versailles
champagne is the alias but no cease and desist in i
i refuse to comply with regulations
i listen to heavy metal for meditation no silence
like sanders on the detroit lions
get a run around and i'll bury you where they won't find ya
motor city casino i'm at the cage with my old license
they tell me don't worry i got your money like osirus

dirty workin on me
tired of women that may tag me in pictures airin my dirty laundry
caterin is from giorgio baldi robyn's favorite
shit is nice but i prefer madeo
calamari rings and tomato
i got the sauce and now shorties keep claimin preggo
wakin up at pm like where does the day go
forecastin tornadoes brainstormin retaliation at dinner tables
was when i lost my halo
i lost a j lo
a rotterdam trip had me on front page though
i had to lay low hot topic like your everyday clothes
closed off but i could never stay closed
billboard awards i claimed out in vegas like surenos
black excellence but i guess when it comes to me it's not the same though all goodie
that just pushed me to do the things we all couldn't
niggas stakin out the crib it's all gravy
protection that god gave me
shit is complex like short niggas round tall ladies
i gotta watch who i'm talkin to like it's all ages
i've seen buddin careers turn to sit around and talk about other careers judgin their peers
knowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here
cover my ears my security government tier
yeah advance the venue so we know the exits
check the guest list
if opps make an appearance at least it's expected
tell em i don't wanna link like a broken necklace
i'll be in better company with my own reflection
mirror mirror on the ceiling of my suite in the royal palace
the tv playin al jazeera
inshallah i hope the mission keeps on gettin clearer
whenever wherever ovo will always be together like shakira
i love i love

all i asked is for a chance to prove that money can't really make me happy
crazy how i blew myself from fucked up predicaments
i mean women inspire me to great things
drake
i need to grow some fucking confidence
and why you gotta say the last words
and if i tell you how i really felt
there probably end up being another argument candy girl
you know everything you thought of me came from yourself
yeah
and that shit starts to get old
and i don't mean to say the most
but you know how they say you are who you hang with
so it bothers me when you hang with hoes
is it wrong of me to tell these women what they wanna hear

love them anyway
say something i'm giving up on you
i'll be the one if you want me to
anywhere i would've followed you

say something i'm giving up on you
i'm sorry that i couldn't get to you
anywhere i would've followed you
say something i'm giving up on you
and i will swallow my pride
you're the one that i love
and i'm saying goodbye
say something i'm giving up on you
and i'm sorry that i couldn't get to you
and anywhere i would have followed you

so many lonely sleepless nights
im going through hell to convince you love me
but never her approval no matter how i try
the way you talk to me but still i say i love you

give it from your heart is what you taught me
addiction to pain is what it got me
my life now its changed
my life aint the same as you are
heartbroken to the point sometimes wanna end it
if i can't have what mean most to me
so many tears i cried
but all for nothing i'm afraid to say
loving you no more

hung out wit celebrities from every drug house
so when you remember me say that i was strung out
mickey what you mean
i'm a addict for the green cash i'm a o d so flip going to rehab
chorus
and i'm so prestigious
i brought my niggas from the hood to the beaches
i'm living good gripping wood with all the features
jesus my money straight no creases
p p peep this
we got bottles over here
kush is in the air we good o d o d
bithces over there we good o d o d
money on the floor we good
o d o d everybody know me
i don't even need a note pad for this one right here man
shut the lights off
let the mind work ya know
i like to uh
i like to take the time to dedicate this to a special somebody
guess i'll call her one of my most recent addition to my collection of female disappointments you know
deceiving you are the reason that
i don't believe in finding the love that i need and
i'm uncle phil i switch wifey like every season
so i guess that makes u ant viv
until u take from me till the point that u can't give
and when i see u out i pass by it's offensive
but what u expect tho
kinda direct yo
cuhz all that dolce and gabana shit was expensive
i told ya
mr edwards i tried to save your daughter
but she wasn't satisfied with none of the things that i bought her
and wasn't tryna show up none of the places that i brought her
and couldn't utilize none of the things that i taught her
so i was just tryna upgrade you
i ain't ya understudy that tryna upstage you
i was ya other buddy that tried to front page you
crown you
get to know the people that surround you
funny to think that i woulda white gowned you
cuz now we sit around the studio and clown you
oops did i let that slip oh my bad did i let that slip
i can't forget that quick
deceiving you you you you deceiving
deceiving you you you you are so deceiving
let me see what im gonna say for the second one yeah i got it hold on uh
deceiving you are the reason that
when it gets cold in november seems like it's freezing
and i fit every stereotype that ya'll believe in
cuhz when i say i'm serious you claim u only teasin
i plan a trip to the tropics that you missed
so when i'm speakin you only in topic when i'm pissed
and in a couple of years i guarantee you'll be thirsty
and by then i'll be lookin like tropicana twist twist
what up tessa i love you like my own mama
and ya daughters getting grown mama
and me i'm just here workin waitin patient
for her to be ready to love and leave her drama
cuhz i don't really wanna fight no more
and i don't wanna diss niggas when i write no more
and i don't wanna bring chicks to the crib
to watch a flick in the basement on the bed with dim lights no more
now i'm losin a feeling
u losin appealing
u need to step it up like prints from shoes on the ceiling
oh damn did i let that slip oh my fault did i let that slip
i can't forget that quick
deceiving you you you you deceiving
deceiving you you you you are so deceiving
my first reaction was damn girl
how did i swing you
i wanted you forever now i'm something you cling to
but u was my angel seems like ya wings grew
unaware you was outta state doin ya thing to
sayin to my self u deceiving
you are the reason that i don't believe in finding the love that i need
and fact i know you always be lyin when u be leavin
goin to visit family promise me u ain't cheatin
a sure thing just might fail you
women often conduct themselves just like males do
they huddle in a group and joke about the fact that u a soft nigga
how u think cuddling with its cute
they laugh at how u think u last when u really don't
and make u think u get the ass when u really wont
and dudes do that and why these hoes stealin it
they doin the same shit with a better job at concealin it
so sign your name on a pre nup and in initials
she only messin with a rapper if it's beneficial
opps did i let that slip oh my bad did i let that slip
